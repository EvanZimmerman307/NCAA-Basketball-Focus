# NCAA-Basketball-Focus
This project won first place in the 2022 ML4VA competition organized by UVA professor Rich Nguyen. 
My co-contributors on this project were Kai Helli and Chris Barfield. 
We created a model that determined a basketball player's ideal position given their advanced seasonal data.
We designed a Polynomial SVM and a Random Forest Classifier that yielded F1 scores of 0.91 and 0.88 respectively. Based on the results of both models, we concluded that in-practice, evaluating both models would provide coaches with the best insights. 
The ML4VA Project Report contains a thorough description of our process and results.
